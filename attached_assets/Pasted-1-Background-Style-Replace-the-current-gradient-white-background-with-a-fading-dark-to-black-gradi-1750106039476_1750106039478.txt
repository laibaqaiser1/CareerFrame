1. Background Style
Replace the current gradient/white background with a fading dark-to-black gradient background.

Use deep charcoal/black as base (#0A0A0A) with a soft gradient upward fade (similar to Tailwind bg-gradient-to-t from-black via-neutral-900 to-[#111827]).
2. Device Mockup Stack ‚Äì Precise Implementation
Recreate the visual device stack shown in the attached reference (Desired Landing Page.png) by arranging four visible device frames, each containing a static CareerFrame UI screenshot.
üß± Placement & Order (Z-index/stacking)
Back layer (z-index: 10):
A MacBook-style laptop mockup
Positioned centered, slightly tilted backward or shown flat
Displays the CareerFrame Milestone Tracker screenshot
Middle-left layer (z-index: 20):
A tablet (iPad style) mockup
Positioned slightly in front of the laptop, left-aligned
Displays the Leaderboard or Dashboard UI screenshot
Middle-right layer (z-index: 20):
A smartphone (iPhone style) mockup
Positioned to the right of the tablet, slightly rotated forward
Displays the Career Coach or CV Upload screen
Front corners (z-index: 30):
Two smartwatches (Apple Watch style)
Placed on the left and right outer corners
Display small cropped versions of XP tracking or milestone stats

üìê Sizing and Perspective
All device mockups should be proportionally scaled:
Laptop width ‚âà 800px
Tablet ‚âà 500px
Phone ‚âà 300px
Watch ‚âà 120px
Maintain 3D perspective or shadow illusion to give a layered depth (you may use a Tailwind utility like drop-shadow-lg or CSS transform: perspective(...))
________________________________________
üìÑ Image Integration
Each device should use a div with a background image (bg-[url('/assets/device-ui.png')]) or <img> inside a styled device frame container
You may use pre-built device frame wrappers like:
@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio
or static SVG/PNG device outlines as containers

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
Do not use placeholder mockups or lorem ipsum ‚Äî use the real CareerFrame UI screenshots previously provided
Do not place all screenshots inside one device ‚Äî they must appear across separate devices as described

üñãÔ∏è 3. Typography & Text Styling
Apply light mint green (#B1D5C8) or the closest extracted hex from the reference image to all headline, nav link, and body text within the hero section.

Update buttons to match the same soft green tone for consistency with the branding in the mockup.

üß© 4. Component Integrity
Do not alter the layout logic of the HeroSection component.

Keep existing motion.div logic, Join For FREE CTA, and call-to-action text structure as-is.

Simply re-skin the visual container and overlay the new mockup elements for brand alignment.


Ensure responsiveness is retained across mobile/tablet.

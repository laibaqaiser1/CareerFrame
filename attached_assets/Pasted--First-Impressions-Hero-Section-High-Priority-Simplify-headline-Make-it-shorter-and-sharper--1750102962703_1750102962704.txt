🎯 First Impressions & Hero Section
🔝 High Priority
Simplify headline: Make it shorter and sharper.

Tell Replit: “Please shorten the hero headline to 1–2 impactful lines that focus on the emotional benefit — e.g., ‘Wake up excited for a career that fulfils you’.”

Clarify what CareerFrame is

Tell Replit: “Add a short subheading or supporting line under the hero title that clarifies CareerFrame is an AI-powered career development platform — not a job board.”

✅ Implementable Now
Add social proof & differentiation

“Include a short row below the hero section showing user count, employer interest, or review snippets. Add a bullet list or icon section highlighting how we differ from LinkedIn or traditional coaches.”

🔍 Value Proposition Clarity
🔝 High Priority
Focus on outcomes, not features

Tell Replit: “Please rewrite the key feature section to focus on the results users get — e.g., ‘Gain clarity in your job search’, ‘Overcome self-doubt’, ‘Land a role you’re proud of’.”

Add time commitment guidance

“Include a short sentence like ‘Spend just 15 minutes a day progressing toward your next career step.’”

⏳ Cannot Implement Immediately
Success metrics (e.g. salary boosts, employment rates) may not yet be available.

Advice: Add a placeholder and gather early metrics as users come onboard.

💰 Pricing & Plan Structure
🔝 High Priority
Clarify freemium limitations

“Add a side-by-side feature comparison table that clearly outlines what’s free vs premium.”

Justify £15/month

“Add value-driven points like: ‘Includes unlimited AI coaching, tailored milestone plans, and recruiter visibility’.”

⏳ Optional for MVP
Trial period or urgency campaigns

If dev time is tight, save urgency mechanics (countdown timers, discounts) for a V2 push.

📱 User Experience Flow
🔝 High Priority
Add demo or platform screenshots

“Please insert 2–3 real screenshots showing the Career Coach, Milestone Tracker, and XP leaderboard.”

Clarify what happens after signup

“Add a ‘What to Expect’ section after CTA: Step 1 – Meet your coach. Step 2 – Get your plan. Step 3 – Begin your journey.”

✅ Implementable Now
Add “About Us” and “Founder” section

“Insert a founder bio with a personal story and mission statement.”

🎨 Visual Design & Trust
Mid Priority
Overwhelming gradients or spacing issues

“Simplify backgrounds behind key sections. Maintain consistent padding between elements.”

Mobile experience

Advice: Use Replit’s preview tools to test mobile responsiveness — if needed, ask: “Can you ensure all CTA buttons and sections stack cleanly on mobile?”

📝 Content & Messaging
🔝 High Priority
Simplify language & CTAs

“Break up long paragraphs into short, scannable lines. Replace ‘Join For FREE’ with something more specific like ‘Start Your Career Plan – Free’.”

Reduce jargon

“Replace terms like ‘ecosystem’ with more relatable alternatives — ‘platform’, ‘support system’, etc.”

🛡️ Trust & Credibility
🔝 High Priority
Founder story

“Add a small bio or quote from the founder about why CareerFrame was created — ideally tied to personal experience.”

Add transparency around AI

“Include a FAQ section explaining how the AI works, how suggestions are generated, and how data is used.”

⏳ Plan for Post-MVP
Guarantees or credentials

Until results or partnerships are validated, use softer language like “Our mission is to get you to your goal, step-by-step — and we’ll support you all the way.”

🎯 Specific Customer Journey Issues
🔝 High Priority
Information overload

“Break up dense sections into tabs or collapsible elements like FAQs.”

Community aspect

“Add a line or banner about team chat features, industry-specific groups, and peer encouragement (even if not live yet).”

# Production Deployment Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing because the `serveStatic` function in `server/vite.ts` was looking for static files in `server/public`, but the Vite build process creates them in `dist/public`.

## Root Cause
- Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) builds frontend assets to `dist/public`
- The `serveStatic` function expects static files at `server/public`
- This mismatch caused production deployments to fail with "missing static file serving configuration"

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed the file serving path**: Copied built static files from `dist/public` to `server/public` after build
2. **Created build script**: Added `build-and-prepare.sh` to automate the copying process
3. **Verified production serving**: Tested that static files are properly served in production mode

## Files Modified
- Created: `build-and-prepare.sh` - Build script that includes static file copying
- Fixed: Static file path issue by copying `dist/public` contents to `server/public`

## Production Build Process
```bash
# 1. Build the application and prepare for production
npm run build

# 2. Copy static files to expected location
cp -r dist/public server/public

# 3. Start production server
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Alternative: Use the prepared script
```bash
# Run the complete build and preparation process
./build-and-prepare.sh

# Then start production server
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## Verification
- ✅ Production server starts successfully
- ✅ Static files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) are served correctly
- ✅ Main application route returns 200 status
- ✅ Asset files are accessible via their proper paths

## Notes
- The `server/vite.ts` file is protected and cannot be edited
- This solution works around the path mismatch by ensuring files exist where expected
- The fix is compatible with existing development and production workflows
